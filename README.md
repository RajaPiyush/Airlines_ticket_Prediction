# Airlines Ticket Price Prediction

## About the Project

- **Objective**: Develop a predictive model to estimate airline ticket prices based on various features such as airline, source, destination, departure time, arrival time, and duration.
- **Purpose**: Provide insights and tools to help travelers and businesses predict ticket prices, enabling more informed decisions.

## About the Data Source

- **Dataset**: The project utilizes a dataset named `Data_Train.xlsx`.
  - **Features**: Includes information on airline, date of journey, source, destination, route, departure time, arrival time, duration, and ticket price.
  - **Data Size**: The dataset comprises multiple entries with several features contributing to the ticket pricing.
  - **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning and preprocessing steps are applied to handle missing values and transform categorical data into numerical formats.

## About the Implementation

### Preprocessing

- **Data Cleaning**: Remove or impute missing values, correct data types, and handle inconsistencies.
- **Feature Engineering**: 
  - Extract meaningful information from date and time features.
  - Encode categorical features using techniques like one-hot encoding.
- **Normalization**: Scale numerical features to ensure uniformity and improve model performance.

### Model Building

- **Splitting Data**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
- **Model Selection**: Experiment with multiple machine learning algorithms to determine the best performer.

### Evaluation

- **Metrics**: Use evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess model accuracy.
- **Validation**: Cross-validation techniques are employed to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability.

## Algorithms Used


- **Decision Tree Regressor**: Captures non-linear relationships in the data through a tree-like structure.
- **Random Forest Regressor**: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive performance and reduce overfitting.
